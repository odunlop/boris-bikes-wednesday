# Boris Bikes

## Introduction
This project is an exercise is trying to emulate the Boris Bike system from London - trying to replicate the code behnd the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on)

## Build Status
The functionality which currently exists:
* User can receive a working bike from a docking station that has at least 1 bike present already.
* User can dock a bike into a docking station.
* An error will be thrown up if a user tries to receive a bike from an empty docking station - this stops the user being charged unnecessarly. 
* An error will be thrown up if the user tries to dock a bike into a docking station that is full.
